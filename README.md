# Project Overview
Real-time 3-axis accelerometer monitoring system featuring interrupt-driven data acquisition, DMA-optimized IÂ²C communication, and FreeRTOS task scheduling
for UART data transfer and blinking LED. I did this project with the goal of learning how to write drivers for peripherals from reading a datasheet, to understand
how to optimize execution time by streamlining data from the peripheral to memory by saving on CPU cycles, and dabble a little bit into FreeRTOS with some 
minor task scheduling. The main resource I used to learn and what Phil's Lab on youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyVemnshlQQ. He goes over a similar
implementation of DMA and FreeRTOS on an accelerometer, although this project differs from his as he use SPI protocol, where as I am using I2C, and he is using
a different accelerometer, he uses the BMI088 and I use a cheaper ADXL345. Check out his video for a more indepth explaination of how to design the firmware
of this project :)!
